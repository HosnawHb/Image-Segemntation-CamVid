# Image-Segementation-CamVid

## Data
 - The Cambridge-driving Labeled Video Database (CamVid) provides ground truth labels that associate each pixel with one of 32 semantic classes. This dataset is often used in (real-time) semantic segmentation research.


 - [CamVid Data](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/VideoRec/CamVid/data/)

## Model
- The model used in this project is Segnet model
- SegNet is a semantic segmentation model. This core trainable segmentation architecture consists of an encoder network, a corresponding decoder network followed by a pixel-wise classification layer.
